Building upon the [Apache Arrow support in v0.6-alpha](https://blog.spiceai.org/posts/2022/02/08/announcing-the-release-of-spice.ai-v0.6-alpha/), Spice.ai now includes new [Apache Arrow data processor](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataprocessors/arrow#readme) and [Apache Arrow Flight data connector](https://github.com/spiceai/data-components-contrib/tree/trunk/dataconnectors/flight#readme) components! Together, these create a high-performance bulk-data transport directly into the Spice.ai ML engine. Coupled with big data systems from the [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) ecosystem like Hive, Drill, Spark, Snowflake, and BigQuery, it's now easier than ever to combine big data with Spice.ai.

And we're also excited to announce the release of [Spice.xyz](https://spice.xyz)! ðŸŽ‰

[Spice.xyz](https://spice.xyz) is data and AI infrastructure for web3. Itâ€™s web3 data made easy. Insanely fast and purpose designed for applications and ML.

Spice.xyz delivers data in [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) format, over high-performance [Apache Arrow Flight APIs](https://arrow.apache.org/blog/2019/10/13/introducing-arrow-flight/) to your application, notebook, ML pipeline, and of course through these new data components, to the Spice.ai runtime.
