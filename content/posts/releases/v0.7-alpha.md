## Highlights in v0.7-alpha

[DataFusion SQL Query Engine](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion): Spice v0.7 leverages the Apache DataFusion query engine to provide very fast, high quality SQL query across one or more local or remote data sources.

Data tables can be locally accelerated using Apache Arrow in-memory or by [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/).
