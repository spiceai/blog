We are excited to announce the release of Spice.ai v0.4.1-alpha! üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Highlights include support for authoring reward functions in a code file, the ability to specify the time of recommendation, and ingestion support for transaction/correlation ids. Authoring reward functions in a code file is a significant improvement to the developer experience than specifying functions inline in the YAML manifest, and we are looking forward to your feedback on it!

If you are new to Spice.ai, check out the [getting started guide](https://docs.spiceai.org/getting-started/) and star [spiceai/spiceai](https://github.com/spiceai/spiceai) on GitHub.

## Highlights in v0.4.1-alpha

### Upgrade using spice upgrade

The `spice upgrade` command was added in the v0.3.1-alpha release, so you can now upgrade from v0.3.1 to v0.4 by simply running `spice upgrade` in your terminal. Special thanks to community member [@Adm28](https://github.com/Adm28) for contributing this feature!

### Reward Function Files

In addition to defining reward code inline, it is now possible to author reward code in functions in a separate Python file.

The reward function file path is defined by the `reward_funcs` property.

A function defined in the code file is mapped to an action by authoring its name in the `with` property of the relevant reward.

## Highlights in v0.4.1-alpha

### AI engine performance improvements

Overall training performance has been improved up to 13% by removing a lock in the AI engine.

In versions before v0.4.1-alpha, performance was especially impacted when streaming new data during a training run.

### Dashboard Observations Datagrid

The dashboard observations datagrid now automatically resizes to the window width, and headers are easier to read, with automatic grouping into dataspaces.

### CLI version detection and upgrade prompt

When it is run, the Spice.ai CLI will now automatically check for new CLI versions once a day maximum.

If it detects a new version, it will print a notification to the console on `spice version`, `spice run` or `spice add` commands prompting the user to upgrade using the new `spice upgrade` command.

## New in this release

- **Adds** automatic resizing of the observations datagrid.
- **Adds** header group by dataspace to the observations datagrid.
- **Adds** CLI version detection and prompt for upgrade on version, run, and add commands.
- **Adds** Support for parsing hex-encoded times and measurements. Use the `time_format` of `hex` or prefix with `0x`.
- **Updates** AI engine with improved training performance.
- **Updates** Go and NPM dependencies.
- **Fixes** detection of Spicepods in the `Spicepods` directory, and a resulting error when loading a non-Spicepod file.
- **Fixes** a potential "zip slip" security issue.
- **Fixes** an issue where the AI engine may not gracefully shutdown.
